title: My Letter To CERT-IN

<div class="gmail_quote" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; border-left: 1px solid #cccccc; padding-left: 1ex;"><h3>CERT-IN has destroyed its credibility</h3><p>It took a single statement to completely demolish the trust which I had in CERT-IN.</p><p>According to your website, your charter is "to become the nation's most trusted referral agency of the Indian community for responding to computer security incidents". It is not a political organization and should not have a political agenda of it's own. Thus it is expected that you have the ability and the intention to analyze a situation objectively.</p><p>However, when a Director General (Dr. Gulshan Rai) of CERT-IN resorts to personal attacks without any basis instead of focusing on the question at hand, it becomes obvious that the personnel of CERT-IN have a political agenda of their own. This completely destroys your credibility and authority to lead a technical organization.</p><p>I am referring to Mr. Gulshan Rai's accusation (source: <a href="http://www.medianama.com/2011/11/223-were-not-a-front-for-anyone-were-not-funded-by-google/" target="_blank">http://www.medianama.com/2011/11/223-were-not-a-front-for-anyone-were-not-funded-by-google/</a> ) at Cyber Security India conference that all of Indian media (like <a href="http://www.medianama.com/" target="_blank">Medianama</a> ) as well as citizen groups like <a href="http://www.medianama.com/" target="_blank">CIS India</a> are financed by MNCs like Google when the interviewer wanted to know about RTI queries on blocking of websites. Instead of dealing with the actual content of the question, he resorted to ad-hominem attacks just like a politician.</p><p>You have destroyed your credibility, made it obvious that the leadership of CERT-IN is politically biased and therefore, I am no longer interested in what you say on any technical issues.</p><p>Regards</p></div>
